For each commodity, a random set of systems are determined to be "producers" with high supply and low price. Another random, but larger set of systems are "consumers" with low supply and high price.

Each day at a random time, commodities are rolled over. Suppliers get a random amount of commodity added, consumers have a random amount taken away. Each planet will have a minimum and maximum amount of commodity, determined randomly.

The price of one unit of a given commodity on a given planet is determined by the amount of said commodity available. More commodity means lower price. Prices are always determined dynamically.

Random events will temporarily affect how much of a given commodity is available on a given planet. These events will last a day and will be broadcast across the in-game news function "An accident on So-and-So has raised the price of Such and Such there"
