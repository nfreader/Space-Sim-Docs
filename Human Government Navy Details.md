## Shifts

Each day is divided up into three eight-hour shifts: 0000-0800 (A), 0800-1600(B) and 1600-0000(C). During each shift, one third of the crew is a charged with manning their assigned posts, another third is ‘at rest’, which can include training, leisure time etc. The remaining crew are asleep. Crews rotate throughout the day.

## Ranks

Inspired by, but not directly copied from real life for the sake of simplicity. One Captain, Quartermaster and Lieutenant (for each department) per ship. Usually operate on their own schedule that doesn’t necessarily line up with shift timing. Ranks below Crew Chief vary from department to department.

###Rear Admiral


###Admiral


### Captain

Oversees day to day operations for the ship. Has final say in any escalated issue. Directly interfaces with higher-level command structure.

### Quartermaster

Essentially the second in command. When on-duty, is charged with oversight on navigation and communication matters. While captains may command several ships over the course of their career, Quartermasters typically stick with one ship for the length of their career and possess an intricate knowledge of a ship’s layout and systems.

### Lieutenant

Typically in charge of a specific department on a ship, be it engineering, weapons or navigation. Answers directly to the Captain or Quartermaster (depending on who’s in charge at the moment).

### Chief

Second in command officers for departments. At least three chiefs per department (one for each shift). In charge of their department when a Lieutenant is not on duty. A chief sticks to their department for the entirety of their career.

### Crew Chief

Floaters. Members of the crew that rotate between departments and possess enough knowledge and skill with each to fill in as necessary. Report directly to the Captain and Quartermaster and Lieutenants as necessary.

## Departments

### Engineering

In charge of atmospheric/life support systems, propulsion, electrical and day to day maintenance.

### Fire Control

Weapon systems fall under the Fire Control department, including point-defense turrets, missiles and nuclear weapons. Also in charge of internal defenses in case of enemy boarding or other criminal activity.

### Flight Operations

The air wing. Fighters, bombers and transports. Any vessel that operates off a ship falls under this department’s jurisdiction.

### Navigation and Communications

Manages vessel maneuvering and communication/interfacing with local air-traffic controllers. Also contains the electronic warfare and intelligence sub-departments.

### Logistical Operations

A catchall with several sub-departments, such as: 

#### Medical Bay

Handles injuries and illnesses suffered by the rest of the crew. Also in charge of the respectful disposal of any remains.

#### Damage Control

Fires, life support systems and triage of injured crew are the responsibilities of Damage Control. Essentially a ship’s fire fighters. Not an actual department, but is staffed as demanded by the nature of emergencies.

#### Cargo Logistics

Manages cargo loading and dispatch of supplies as requested.

#### Crew Upkeep

Cleaning and food preparation.

### Other Departments

Depending on a vessel’s operational mission, several crewmembers with specialized roles may be stationed on a ship.
