#Space Sim Overview

Space Sim is multiplayer a browser based RPG that borrows elements from several other games. 

##Gameplay 
Players pilot their ship throughout the galaxy, ferrying commodity cargo, completing missions or attacking other players as they go. Credits (the game currency) gained from these actions can be used to upgrade ships with more powerful outfits, purchase new ships altogether, and even be used to create entirely new governments.

##In depth mechanics
###Navigation 
Spobs are planets, moons, and space stations (navigable ports) that players can land on. Commodities, fuel, new ships and outfits can be acquired here. A spob's techlevel affects the cost and availability of certain items. Systems contain spobs and can belong to a specific government. Systems orbit stars. Using Bluespace technology, pilots can travel between systems at faster-than-light speeds. Distances that would conventionally take months or years to cross can be closed in only a matter of minutes. Systems orbiting distant stars can be reached in a matter of hours. 

The jumps between systems orbiting different stars are designed as a "time sink", intended to prevent players from blitzing across the entire map before other players have a chance to react. This also focuses player activity into a star's given set of systems. 

Each Bluespace 'jump' consumes one unit of fuel. Fuel can be reacquired on any spob, with the unit cost based on the spob's techlevel (higher tech means lower cost) and it's type: 

* Planets modify the fuel cost by 1
* Moons modify fuel cost by .75
* Stations modify fuel cost by 1.5

###Governments 
There are three categories of governments

####Non-Affiliated
The Association of Non-Affiliated Pilots (ANAP) is the de facto 'independent' government that all players are members of by default. This quasi government has no leaders or special functions. All other governments (except Pirates) are neutral with ANAP and cannot establish any sort of diplomatic relationship with it.

####Pirates
Players who accumulate enough negative legal points are automatically placed into the pirate quasi governemtn. Pirates function identically to ANAP, except all governments consider Pirate players fair game at all times.

####Regular Governments
With enough credits, players (who aren't Pirates) can establish their own governments. A few government powers include: 

* Managing their own membership (allowing new members, removing, promoting to offices)
* Levying taxes on commodity trading by non-government members
* Forming alliances with other regular governments, or declaring war on them
