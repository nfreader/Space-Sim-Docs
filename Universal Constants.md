##Abstract

You’re driving through a giant warehouse in a fancy sports car at high speeds. That’s awesome. Now imagine you’re doing all that and dodging around complex, unbreakable pillars. Now it’s even more awesome. This document lays out those pillars.

## Simplified Astronomical Unit

An astronomical unit is specified as the mean distance between Earth and the Sun, which is ~149 million kilometers. This has been simplified and rounded up to 150 million kilometers even to create the sAU.

## Relative Coordinate System

A three coordinate system relying on a contact’s “height”, distance and angle, where the centerpoint is the vessel in question. Height is based on the target’s altitude above the artificial horizon plane of the vessel. Angle is the target’s position along a 360˚ arc, relative to the vessel’s bow (which is at 0˚). Distance is self explanatory and represented in thousands of kilometers (1000 kilometers = 1 klick).

## Stellar Coordinate System

Represented with three coordinates: X, Y and Z, where 0, 0, 0 is the centerpoint of the system’s star (or the Barycenter point in a bi- or trinary%2B star system). Distances are represented in sAU. Used when navigating within a system. In regions of space with no landmarks (stars), the centerpoint for the SCS can be arbitrarily defined using GCS coordinates.

## Galactic Coordinate System

The locations and movements of stellar bodies are calculated and modeled by various government and corporate groups. This data is periodically made available for public consumption and interpretation.

## FTL Transit

Transitioning from one system to another is a complex challenge, culminating with the creation and projection of a rift into and then out of “bluespace”.

The challenging part is determining the location of the exit “rift”. This task falls on the FTL calculation computer. Ten to eleven &nbsp;models of celestial body movements/locations are fed in and then averaged to generate a relatively accurate (± .25 sAU (37.5 million kilometers)) picture of the local galactic neighborhood. Then, instead of specifying coordinates, a user simply selects the star system and stellar body they wish to arrive at.

The entrance rift is generated and projected, based on hardcoded values about the vessel’s height, length and width. Current velocity is also taken into account to determine how long the entrance rift needs to be sustained.

The exit rift is slightly more complicated. Traveling through bluespace is not an exact science. The further the distance between the point of origin and the destination in “realspace” is proportional to how far a ship travels in bluespace. Due to various gravimetric and electromagnetic disturbances in bluespace, a vessel may skew off course by a few centimeters. In realspace, those centimeters translate to whole meters. The FTL computer takes this realspace distance into account and opens a correspondingly wider exit rift to ensure that the entire mass of the vessel exits bluespace.

Astute observers can use the exit rift’s size and angle to determine a vessel’s point of origin.

FTL computers will set the exit point to be within 1 million kilometers of a lagrangian point. These regions are intended for FTL exit points only and must be exited as quickly as possible. Vessels drifting into the region around a lagrangian point will typically be shouted at by traffic control to vacate.

A user may override the preference for a lagrangian region, but will be the target of much derision by traffic control.

## Bluespace

An entrance rift is created by the manipulation of space-time and dark matter through processes only understood by a few incredibly intelligent physicists. What is understood is that the medium that permeates bluespace is susceptible to leaking electromagnetic radiation from vessels. This generates a cloud of Cherenkov radiation around any vessel traveling through bluespace.

Some of this radiation will leak through before an entrance or exit rift has been fully generated. Most vessels are equipped to detect this radiation from an exit rift and will normally have a few minutes to escape before they are annihilated by the exit rift.

## FTL Transit Caveats

• A vessel or object crossing the outer edge of a rift, or partially inside/outside the rift when it closes will be “sliced” between atoms. This typically results in an energetic reaction and complete annihilation of said object.

• An unattended rift will eventually collapse on itself, releasing tremendous electromagnetic energy. The effects of this on nearby vessels and other structures usually results in their complete destruction.

• Make sure your rift generators and projectors are working properly before you enter bluespace. You do not want to get stuck in bluespace.

• Entrance or exit rifts cannot be generated in-atmosphere, as they collapse instantaneously (and harmlessly) due to planetary magnetic and gravitational fields (for this reason, all FTL Communication Satellites are space-based)

## FTL Communications

Most communications within a system (ship-to-ship or ship-to-station etc etc) take place via standard terrestrial radios and communication mediums.

Communications between systems are accomplished by way of “FTL Communication Satellites”. Small, sustained rifts are enclosed within heavily armored satellites/space stations. A vessel sending a message from System A to System B will first transmit the message to System A’s FTL Sat. From there, it will be converted and transmitted instantaneously through bluespace to the FTL Sat in System B. From there it will be retransmitted to the intended destination. Thusly, the only latency experienced is the time it takes a message to be transmitted over standard in-system radios.

FTL Satellites are protected by interstellar treaty and administered by an independent non-governmental organization called the Interstellar Communication Facilitation and Management Authority (ICFMA). Tampering with or destroying an FTL Satellite is grounds for immediate destruction.

## FTL Drive Hardware

Tampering with an FTL computer is one of the best ways to ensure the complete destruction or immobilization of your vessel.

Frequently, the primary FTL Computer itself is tied directly to the power management system of a vessel. As a failsafe, cutting power to the FTL Computer will cut power to the entire vessel. Unless directly overridden, software failsafes will also shut down the FTL Computer and vessel’s power.

Even if someone manages to get past all the authentication blocks and failsafes to manipulate the FTL calculations manually, they still run an incredibly high risk of annihilation, as the calculations have a very small margin of error.

Additionally, most vessels are configured to broadcast an emergency signal if an FTL Computer is tampered with.

## Shifts

Each day is divided up into three eight-hour shifts: 0000-0800 (A), 0800-1600(B) and 1600-0000(C). During each shift, one third of the crew is a charged with manning their assigned posts, another third is ‘at rest’, which can include training, leisure time etc. The remaining crew are asleep. Crews rotate throughout the day.

## Ranks

Inspired by, but not directly copied from real life for the sake of simplicity. One Captain, Quartermaster and Lieutenant (for each department) per ship. Usually operate on their own schedule that doesn’t necessarily line up with shift timing. Ranks below Crew Chief vary from department to department.

### Captain

Oversees day to day operations for the ship. Has final say in any escalated issue. Directly interfaces with higher-level command structure.

### Quartermaster

Essentially the second in command. When on-duty, is charged with oversight on navigation and communication matters. While captains command several ships in their career, Quartermasters typically stick with one ship for the length of their career and possess an intricate knowledge of a ship’s layout and systems.

### Lieutenant

Typically in charge of a specific department on a ship, be it engineering, weapons or navigation. Answers directly to the Captain or Quartermaster (depending on who’s in charge at the moment).

### Chief

Second in command officers for departments. At least three chiefs per department (one for each shift). In charge of their department when a Lieutenant is not on duty. A chief sticks to their department for the entirety of their career.

### Crew Chief

Floaters. Members of the crew that rotate between departments and possess enough knowledge and skill with each to fill in as necessary. Report directly to the Captain and Quartermaster and Lieutenants as necessary.

## Departments

### Engineering

In charge of atmospheric/life support systems, propulsion, electrical and day to day maintenance.

### Fire Control

Weapon systems fall under the Fire Control department, including point-defense turrets, missiles and nuclear weapons. Also in charge of internal defenses in case of enemy boarding or other criminal activity.

### Flight Operations

The air wing. Fighters, bombers and transports. Any vessel that operates off a ship falls under this department’s jurisdiction.

### Navigation and Communications

Manages vessel maneuvering and communication/interfacing with local air-traffic controllers. Also contains the electronic warfare and intelligence sub-departments.

### Logistical Operations

A catchall with several sub-departments

#### Medical Bay

Handles injuries and illnesses suffered by the rest of the crew. Also in charge of the respectful disposal of any remains.

#### Damage Control

Fires, depressurization and triage of injured crew are the responsibilities of Damage Control. Essentially a ship’s fire fighters.

#### Cargo Logistics

Manages cargo loading and dispatch of supplies as requested.

#### Crew Upkeep

Cleaning and food preparation.

### Other Departments

Depending on a vessel’s operational mission, several crewmembers with specialized roles may be stationed on a ship.
